## Problem Explanation:

Traditional Yard system.
This problem is linked to farmers. Let’s understand problem with real time situation . So whenever Crop got ready for sell at that time farmer take their crops to APMC(Agricultural Produce Market Committee) Market yard. It’s a government organization who handles the crops inventory . It owns big market yards , where farmer can reach to traders and can sell crops to traders. So what exactly happens is , whenever farmer take their crops to APMC yard at that time they can only access few traders and so they have to face lower price for their product and they forced to sell their crops at lower price because of economical problems. Also sometime they have to keep their unsold crops to market yard for 3 or 4 days . at that times if rain comes then crops get ruined . Every year lots of kgs of crops get ruined that way . Also during the selling times , everyone has to face lot’s of traffic that is uncontrollable . So we tried to solve that problems by our app.

## Solution: 

So we have made an application named Cropyard that fill the gap between trader and farmers . In that app farmers can list their crops and traders from any location can reach to farmers directly so farmer gets access to lot’s of traders all over to world. So chances gets high of getting good price of their crops. So our app is made for APMC yard . so they can use our app and make yard system digital. 
Let’s take a realtime situation . A farmer list his crops on our application . So traders from all over world can see the picture of the crops and they can reach to farmers. Let’s say a trader is from Rajkot and farmers is from Porbandar. If the trader buys the crops from the farmer at that time farmers and traders talk to eachother about transportation .Let’s say farmer agreed to take his crop to Rajkot market yard . now he just give it to trader. So they don’t have to wait for 3 4 days on market yard. So they can save their crops get ruined by rains. Also whenever crops got sold only that time farmer have to reach to market yard so traffic problem also got solved .

## Benefits to our country: 

In tradition situation , let’s say a trader bought crops from a farmer at 500/20 kg. now the trader sold this crops to international trader to 700/20kg. 
So if APMC use our app , in that situation even if farmer list his crops for 600/20kg at that time both international trader and farmers are in profit . so due to lower price more and more international traders will get attracted to our country . So it’ll help our country’s economy .

That’s our detailed explanation and vision of our app .This app is made for APMC.
